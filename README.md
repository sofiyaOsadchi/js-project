# JavaScript Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript projects I developed as part of my advanced studies in web development. Each project is designed to showcase my skills in web programming, my understanding of interactive web applications, and my ability to engage users through thoughtful and creative implementations.

## Project Overview

The portfolio features six distinct projects, including four that are inspired by the captivating universe of Harry Potter. These projects not only demonstrate my technical prowess but also my creative approach to user experience design:

1. **Sorting Hat Quiz**: An interactive quiz that assigns users to one of the Hogwarts houses based on their answers, mirroring the Sorting Hat ceremony. This project emphasizes conditional logic and user interaction.

2. **Character Encyclopedia**: Utilizes API technology to fetch and display information about various Harry Potter characters, showcasing my ability to work with external data and present it in a user-friendly format.

3. **Potion Class**: Offers users a chance to mix their own magical potions, simulating a Hogwarts potion class. This game tests the user's timing and accuracy, demonstrating dynamic DOM manipulation and event handling.

4. **Catch the Snitch**: A game designed to challenge users' reflexes as they try to catch the Golden Snitch. It features adjustable difficulty levels and best score tracking.

Additionally, the portfolio includes:

- **Snake Game**: A rendition of the classic game, which focuses on array manipulation and game logic.
  
- **Math Game**: An educational tool that encourages users to solve math calculation. 

## Learning Insights

Through the development of these projects, I have deepened my knowledge of JavaScript, exploring its potential to create rich, interactive web experiences. I've gained proficiency in DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous programming, and integrating third-party APIs. Each project served as a platform to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios, solidifying my understanding and expertise in web development.
